README for Project-2---Tournament-Results

This is a backend for running a Swiss Pairing style tournament. Players can be registered and deleted, and match results can be recorded. The backend also returns the player standings at any time, regardless of whether they have participated in a match or not, and it will pair players in advance for each match.

Install by using the "tournament.sql" file by first creating the "tournament" database and creating the necessary tables and views.

After table and view creation, interaction with the backend is through the "tournament.py" file. Using these calls, you can run the Swiss Tournament. # Project-2---Tournament-Results
